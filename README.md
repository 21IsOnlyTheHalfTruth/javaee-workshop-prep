# Intro
This repository could be a starting point of this workshop's programming project.
If you want to, you could generate your own starter code on https://code.quarkus.io/ .

However, note that this project has been created specifically using Java 11 and Quarkus 2.13.8 to fit the Dedalus tech stack, whereas - as of writing - 
the code generator on quarkus.io will use the recommended Java version 17 and Quarkus 3.1.

# Generated Intro
From this point on, this file contains Quarkus' auto-generated README.md.
The run instructions should be suitable for your projects.

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: https://quarkus.io/ .

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.
